This repo will house all software needed for the Bottling Change Part Wear Measuring Project:

## Project Overview
### Background
Gallo's bottling facility in Modesto California produces several million cases annually. Most of these cases are
produced in glass bottles. These bottles need to be transferred smoothly inside filling, capping, and corking equipment
to maintain quality. Typically, plastic change parts are used in this application.
### Problem
The plastic used to transfer and position bottles wears over time. As the plastic wears the pockets that these bottles fit
into enlarge allowing for unwanted bottle movement. If the pocket becomes too large quality defects can be
introduced on the finished product.
### Objectives
Design a computer vision-based tool that can be used to measure the pocket size in a variety of change parts. The goal
is to have a tool that is operational with one hand, provides repeatable measurements independent of person using the
tool, and measures down to 10 thousands of an inch. Ideally this too would be integrated with Gallo's internal parts
identification tool.
